Try one or more of the following: Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link \"To send this message again, click here.\" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send. If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below. Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.1.10 This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following: The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages. Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory. Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature. Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit). Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly. For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.

We would like to thank all of you for your consistent hard work and persistence that has helped the country tackle the Covid-19 pandemic confidently. Your continuous support and tenacity is helping the Indian economy make a strong recovery from global economic downturn. In the past year, the Ministry has been proactive in trying to reduce the burden of pandemic among the MSMEs in the country. The government had announced a comprehensive economic package under the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' initiative that aimed at holistically improve the MSME eco-system in the country. Other than those the Ministry has introduced important interventions such as the Champions Portal and Udyam Registration portal to digitize delivery of services. In the new year, we pledge to continue our efforts to support the MSME sector and hope that this new year will bring you and your family health and prosperity.

      "Not Required DSN Your message couldn't be delivered to multiple recipients. The recipients weren't found at centelon.com. operations Office 365 Recipients Action Required Recipients Unknown To address Couldn't deliver to the following recipients: gokul.karuppuswamy@centelon.com, avinash.jadhav@centelon.com How to Fix It The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following: Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link \"To send this message again, click here.\" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send. Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct. The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly. Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send. If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below. Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.1.10 This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.

The recipients weren't found at centelon.com. operations Office 365 Recipients Action Required Recipients Unknown To address Couldn't deliver to the following recipients: gokul.karuppuswamy@centelon.com, avinash.jadhav@centelon.com How to Fix It The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following: Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link \"To send this message again, click here.\" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send. Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct. The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly. Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send. If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below. Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.1.10 This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.

      "Not Required DSN Your message to nitish.gupta@centelon.com couldn't be delivered. nitish.gupta wasn't found at centelon.com. operations Office 365 nitish.gupta Action Required Recipient Unknown To address How to Fix It The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following: Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link \"To send this message again, click here.\" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send. Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct. The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly. Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send. If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below. Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.1.10 This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.
