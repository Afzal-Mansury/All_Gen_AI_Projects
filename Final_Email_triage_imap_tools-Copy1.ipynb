      "Above except condition Hi Matt As discussed, I need your help to get a visa for my colleague Pankaj. Pankaj is a Director with Centelon India and needs a visa (min 2 yrs, more is better) which allows him to come for short NZ assignments and return back after completion. He will continue to remain permanently employed with Centelon India and Centelon NZ might pay to Centelon India for his services rendered on daily rate basis. Sometimes he may even come for sales meetings and industry events, where we may take care of his expenses but not have any service fee paid. As mentioned, we had engaged with an agent last year to do this for us (before we engaged EY) and for some reasons this case didnât get initiated till couple of months back. Our experience was not good and we recently requested him to stop the process. I believe an online application was initiated but not submitted. I will request extra attention on this case to check whether anything was submitted or not, and to avoid any inconsistency that may cause us any challenges with Immigration NZ. Pl advise what do you need so Swati can take this forward. FYI, medical and police verifications are already done \n",

      "Above except condition Hi, Please find attached filled documents as requested for me and my partner. Please note that currently my wife is not having passport and will get it by couple of weeks. So for now I am not providing her passport copies and consent. Please start with my visa procedure as it is urgent and let me know how can she get it later. I will provide police verification and medical certificates as soon as possible. Please let me know in case any more details are required from my side. Thanks, Rohit Pund On Wed, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:16 AM, Pengbo Jiang <Pengbo.Jiang@nz.ey.com> wrote: Dear Rohit, As you are aware, we have been asked by Centelon (âyour employerâ) to assist you and your wife with your New Zealand visa applications. My name is Pengbo and I will be your key contact during this process. I look forward to working with you. Evidence of my immigration licence can be found here. 1. OVERVIEW New Zealand visa applications need to be lodged at the Visa Application Centre (âVACâ) closest to your place of current residence. We understand that you and your wife are currently living in India.Â  As Immigration New Zealand (âINZâ) does not have the online capability to process online applications for dependent family at the moment, you must lodge your visa applications with the VAC in India directly.Â  You may courier your applications to the VAC in India if you prefer. We will assist you by reviewing all your supporting documents and preparing your visa applications for lodgement. In order to assist us in this process, we request that you scan and email us copies of the documents listed in this email. Once all your documents have been reviewed by us we will complete your visa application forms on your behalf and email them to you for your signatures along with detailed instructions regarding how and where to submit your visa applications to the VAC. When you lodge your application with the VAC you must also lodge your passports.Â  Therefore, we recommend that no international travel plans are made prior to a decision by Immigration New Zealand (âINZâ) on your applications.Â  Please note, we also highly recommend that you do not make any permanent arrangements (travel, moving or otherwise) to move to New Zealand until such time as you are issued with a New Zealand visa. Please read this email carefully as it provides valuable information about the application process, timeframes and evidentiary requirements. 2. FOR YOUR ACTION a) Questionnaires Please complete the attached questionnaires as fully as possible and return them to us via email.Â  These questionnaires will form the basis of your New Zealand visa applications.Â  We will assist you (âPrincipal applicantâ) with a work visa application under the Specific Purpose or Event work visa instructions.Â We will assist your wife with a Family Stream Work Visa application. b) Client Authorisation, Consent and Acknowledgement Form Please review and sign the attached Client Authorisation, Consent and Acknowledgement forms and return them to us along with your completed questionnaires. Please let us know if you have any queries in regards to these forms. c) Passport photos Your applications will require a total of 2 passport photos each. Your photos must be no more than 6 months old at the time of lodgement.Â  We do not require a copy of these photos. 3. HEALTH AND CHARACTER CHECKS Every person who enters New Zealand must be of an acceptable standard of health and of good character. a) Acceptable Standard of Health As you and your wife will be in New Zealand for more than 12 months, you must each obtain evidence of your standard of health by way of medical and chest x-ray certificates. Children under the age of 11 and pregnant women are not required to provide chest x-ray certificates. You will need to obtain your medical and chest X-ray certificates via an approved panel physician.Â  The list of approved panel physicians can be found at the following link. Your medical results will be submitted online to Immigration New Zealand directly by your panel physician.Â  Therefore, once you have completed your medical examinations, we ask you to request a copy of your results from your panel physician.Â  For your information, the medical certificates that we require to review should be approximately 6 pages in length and is entitled âHealth case detailsâ.Â  These documents will contain all results taken at your medical examination, including your medical history.Â  Â Please note that you are entitled to a copy of your full e-medical certificates at no extra charge.Â  We also ask that you forward us a copy of any correspondence received from your panel physician including a copy of your medical examination results. Please take the following documents with you to your medical appointment: Your identity documents (i.e., your passports) Your glasses (spectacles) or contact lenses if you use them A list of any medication you are taking (including dosage) Any relevant medical reports or X-rays regarding your current or historical health matters Please note that medical checks are only valid for 3 months from the date of issue. There will be a fee associated with undertaking this medical exam, which you will be required to pay directly to the medical clinic under their terms and conditions.Â  As each clinic varies their cost associated with immigration medicals, we strongly suggest you check the fee payable for the examination when making an appointment. b) Good Character In order for INZ to grant you and your wife with a visa they also need to be assured that you are each of good character. As you will be in New Zealand for more than 24 months, you and your wife must each obtain the following documents as evidence of your good character: Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A police background check from your countries of citizenship; AND Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Any other country you have lived in for 5 years or more since the age of 17. Further guidance on obtaining police background certificates can be found on the INZ website here. Please note that police checks are only valid for 6 months from the date of issue. When you seek a police certificate from the relevant authority there will likely be a fee involved. You will be required to pay this fee directly to the relevant authority when requesting the certificate(s). On the attached questionnaires we ask you to inform us as to whether either of you have ever had any criminal convictions, cautions, warnings, etc.Â  If this applies to either of you, please disclose all matters to us on the questionnaires. 4.

When you submit your final visa applications to the VAC, you must lodge your passports.Â  Supporting documents lodged can either be the original or a clear photocopy of the original document. All documents must be in English or be accompanied by an official translation.Â  Instructions on how to obtain an official translation can be found here. 5. GENUINE AND STABLE RELATIONSHIP In support of your wifeâs application you will need to lodge proof that you have been living together in a genuine partnership that is credible and stable.

Evidence that you and your wife are living together may include: Â· Joint ownership of property Â· Joint tenancy agreement, rent book or rental receipts Â· Correspondence (including postmarked envelopes) addressed to both you and your wife (whether individually or jointly) at the same address.

      "Above except condition Hi Ajit, Hope youâre well.Â  Chubb have reviewed the updated information and commented that the risk has changed significantly from the last time they understood it. The current Policy is rated on the basis of a $950,000 revenue (See latest declaration provided). They are currently aware of the Australian and New Zealand entities although the Indian and Singaporean companies are new information, of course (see the initial completed proposal attached). Having said that, under the premier wording, subsidiaries are automatically covered provided their business activities are similar to the parent and their revenue is less than 20% of the consolidated revenue of parent. With the level of revenue and rapid expansion overseas, Chubb wish to review your Policy in full. Â They have suggested that a new proposal form be completed in order that they may collate all necessary updated information.Â  A proposal form is attached. Given the expansion of your activities, we also suggest that you may wish to look at a higher limit.Â  Your Policy currently has a limit which stands at just $2,000,000 and, notably, there is no cover currently provided under technology-related injury section (breach of privacy/intellectual property cover). We would suggest that you think about increasing your current limit and including at least a $1,000,000 Technology-related Injury limit so that you are also covered in the event of privacy/intellectual property breach type of scenario. In terms of overseas entities,Â  the New Zealand and Singaporean entities are fine, however, India is a little bit trickier as non-admitted policy are not allowed in India (ie Indian legislation requires insurance to be placed locally). This does not mean the policy will not extend to cover India as their territorial limit is worldwide. However, it just means that Chubb will not be allowed to pay claim directly to Indian entity. In the event of a claim in India, the claim payment will be paid to your Australian entity and you will need to find a means to transfer that claim back to India (which may be subjected to tax etc). We recommend that you seek separate insurance locally in India which we can help facilitate through our colleagues there unless you have another preferred supplier there?. Once you have had a chance to go through the above points, perhaps drop us a note or give us a call so that we can discuss further. Best \n",

      " CISL2021125 dhundo isse Dear Supplier Representative As a valued supplier, I am writing to request your organisation's registration within the Origin Vendor Portal. At Origin we recognise our purpose as Getting energy right for our customers, communities and planet. For our supply chain, this means being mindful of the ethical, social and environmental impacts of our purchasing decisions. The Origin Vendor Portal has been created to help us and our suppliers to better understand the impacts of our mutual supply chain. This transparency will provide opportunities for collaboration, to better manage risks and improve outcomes. Registering your business in the portal is free and has been designed to be asÂ quick and easy as possible. During the registration you will be asked to affirm your organisation's acceptance ofÂ Origin's Supplier Code, which outlines the attributes we expect our suppliers to demonstrate as part of an ethical supply chain. You will also be asked essential questions about the following: Key business informationDiversityYour business' capabilities The Origin Vendor Portal is a key tool for the two-way sharing of information with our suppliers, so I encourage you to register as soon as possible. To commence registration, please refer to the invitation email you will be sent shortly from our provider Informed 365 (info@informed365.com). This email will include a link to the portal and contact details for support during the registration process. Please see FAQs below for your reference. Should you have any concerns about the authenticity of this request, you are encouraged to seek verification from your usual Origin representative. Yours sincerely, Stuart Hatton Chief Procurement Officer Origin Level 24, 180 Ann Street, Brisbane QLD 4000 FAQs What is the Origin Vendor Portal (OVP)? The OVP is a web-based portal for registering and maintaining essential information about your business and the goods and services it can provide to Origin. Why is Origin implementing the OVP? Procuring goods and services in a responsible way is essential to achieving our purpose of \"Getting energy right for our customers, communities and planet\". The OVP has been created to support this purpose, enabling both Origin and our suppliers to better understand and manage our social and environmental impacts and identify ongoing opportunities for improvement. What are some of the \"real\" outcomes that the OVP will support? The portal will help Origin and our suppliers to: Eliminate commodity-driven deforestation from the supply chainIdentify and manage modern slavery riskReduce short-lived climate pollutants generated through the supply chainImprove payment terms for small businessesIncrease spending with regional and indigenous businessesCommunicate more efficiently This list is non-exhaustive and there will be other emerging opportunities that the OVP will support. Is there any cost for me to register in the portal? No, it is completely free. What do I need to do to register? Wait to receive an email invitation from info@informed365.com within the next few days Follow the link in the invitation email Select \"Register\" to create your login details Select \"Create a new submission\" Select \"Origin Energy Social Responsibility Survey\" from the dropdown, then click \"Save\" to start the questionnaire You can see sections (with completed status) on the left side of the page. There is also a percentage progress indicator on the top right Note some additional sections/questions may appear, depending on the answers you provide The survey autosaves as you progress through it Once you have completed all sections (including all mandatory questions), the progress indicator will show \"100%\" and a \"Submit\" button will be visible at the bottom of the page Click \"Submit\". Once submitted, you cannot edit your response What type of questions will I be required to answer? Questions fall into the following three categories: Essential business and contact details Diversity Questions about the goods and/or services your organisation provides The question set is dynamic, meaning that we will only ask you the questions that are relevant to your business, based on the answers you provide. How long will it take me to complete the OVP registration? This will vary depending on two factors: As the questionnaire is dynamic, the number of questions asked will depend on the social and environmental risk profile associated with the goods/services your organisation offers (typically lower risk = less questions) How readily you are able to locate the information required for registration As a general guide however, smaller, lower risk suppliers will typically be able to complete the registration in less than 30 minutes. Larger, higher risk suppliers may need over an hour. What if I decline to register in the portal? Origin expects that our suppliers will be supportive of our socially responsible procurement programme. This programme is central to our organisational purpose and will form part of how we will demonstrate compliance with the forthcoming Australian Modern Slavery Act. Who should I contact if I am having difficulty understanding or answering the portal registration questions? In the first instance, please contact support@informed365.com to request assistance or a call back. How securely will my information be stored? The Origin IT security team have confirmed that the third-party provider hosting the portal (\"Informed 365\") has the appropriate cyber security controls in place to securely manage the data that you provide. What if things change and my questionnaire responses are no longer accurate? We expect you to login and provide an updated submission for significant changes, and to log in not less than once per year to reconfirm or update the information you have provided. To save time, you can duplicate a previously submitted form which will then mean you only need to edit those questions where your response has changed. If I have a concern, or want to find out more about the vendor portal and Origin's Supplier Code, who can I contact? Please liaise with your usual Origin Contract Owner, Procurement Representative, or contact the Origin Procurement team at vendor.portal@originenergy.com.au Note: This email, including any attachments, is confidential. If you have received this email in error, please advise the sender and delete it and all copies of it from your system.

      " CISL2021125 mujhe python sikhna hai Urgent Message from Chandler Macleod Click here if you are having trouble viewing this message. COVID-19 TRAVEL UPDATE 16th March 2020 The Australian Government announcement on the 15th March 2020, declared that all international travellers will need to self-quarantine for a period of 14 days. And advises Australians to avoid travel outside Australia. This directive applies to all travellers, regardless of the country they arrive from and regardless of whether they have any symptoms or not. This is a Federal Government decision. What does this mean if you have travelled? You must complete a 14-day self-quarantine if you have travelled internationally in the past 14 days. You are not permitted to return to work/shifts unless you have completed the self-quarantine period. At the completion of the 14-day period, if you are well, please contact your consultant for further instruction regarding your ability to recommence work. Iâm a FIFO worker does this apply to me? Workers who travel to Australia from an international destination will need to self-quarantine for a period of 14-days before attending site / the workplace. We understand that information is changing daily and strongly recommend that your stay up to date on changes via reputable sources such as government websites. \n",

      " CISL2021125 mujhe python sikhna hai Dear Sir / Madam,Request you to get the attached Form 11Â filled from all your employees and from all the new joinees henceforth.Â  It serves the following purpose:If the new employee was a member of the Employeesâ Provident Fund Scheme earlier, he will continue to get benefits of the scheme but under a new Member ID.If the new employee was not a member of EPFO during his past employment or was not employed before and his salary is more than â¹ 15,000Â p.m. in the new employment, he can optÂ notÂ to contribute for EPF/EPS. Such an employeeÂ is known asÂ anÂ Excluded Employee.Â  Members receiving PF pension or those who have withdrawn their PF at an earlier date are also considered as excluded employees.The form can also be used to automatically transfer the PF amount from the previous account to a new one.This declaration form also enables the Provident Fund Department to maintain a comprehensive database which contains important details of the employees. It also helps them significantly during inspections, audits, cross-checking or verification of facts.Hence please maintain these forms for your records.\n",

For existing licenses/subscriptions, the new pricing will apply to your next renewal term. On February 2, 2024 PT, server support will end.

      "Atlassian Simplifying our self-managed offerings Upcoming changes to our server and DataÂ Center products Hello, We wanted to let you know about some important changes we're making to our server and DataÂ Center offerings as we sharpen our focus to be a cloud-first company.

Today, the majority of you are already benefitting from the advantages of cloud, like streamlined administration, instant scalability, and quicker time to value. But, when it comes to delivering a world-class cloud experience, we've heard that you need us to move faster and go further. In response, we are simplifying our self-managed offerings. It looks like you have one or more expired server or DataÂ Center licenses. If you want to gain all the benefits of support and maintenance, you can renew your expired server license until February 2, 2024 PT. If you are interested in restarting your DataÂ Center subscription, you can do so at any time here. The following changes will go into effect on February 2, 2021 PT: â¢ End of new server license sales: You can no longer purchase or request a quote for a new server product. â¢ Updates to server and DataÂ Center prices: New prices for server and DataÂ Center will go into effect. For existing licenses/subscriptions, the new pricing will apply to your next renewal term. On February 2, 2024 PT, server support will end. Support and bug fixes will no longer be available for server products. Read more about why we've made this announcement and visit our website for additional details about these changes.
