Try one or more of the following: Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link \"To send this message again, click here.\" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send. If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below. Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.1.10 This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following: The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages. Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory. Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature. Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit). Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly. For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.

      "Assessment of eligibility for visa transfer  - Anjani Kumar TIWARI\n",
      " CISL2021125 mujhe python sikhna hai Hi Mathew Thank you for your email in respect of your potential candidate Anjani Kumar Tiwari. We understand the business is seeking to transfer his current subclass 457 visa to Centelon. We have reviewed the documentation provided and detail our assessment below. Occupation Classification Based on the position description provided, we assess that the position of Senior Consultant is most closely associated with the immigration occupation of Developer Programmer. Please see the description of Developer Programmer here. The business is ultimately responsible for certifying that a significant majority of the tasks and duties of the nominated position align with the chosen ANZSCO classification. Please confirm if this position aligns with the suggested ANZSCO classification above. This occupation is currently on the Medium and Longâterm Skilled Occupation List. After Anjani transfers his 457 visa to Centelon, he would also be eligible to renew his visa for a further four years and may have a pathway to permanent residency. Transfer of Subclass 457 visa We understand that Anjaniâs current Subclass 457 will expire on 29 March 2021.Â  In order to transfer Anjaniâs current subclass 457 visa under Centelonâs sponsorship, we will need to prepare and lodge a TSS nomination application only and not a new TSS visa application. The TSS nomination application must finalised by the immigration department before Anjani can commence employment with Centelon. Â Following nomination approval, subject to any need for Anjani to serve a reasonable notice period with his current employer, Anjani must only work for Centelon. Anjaniâs visa expiry date will remain 29 March 2021 and he will need to make a further application for a TSS visa to continue working for Centelon after this date. Alternatively, you may choose to lodge a further TSS visa for Anjani now, along with the nomination application. Skill Level When submitting a nomination application, the business must declare that the qualifications and experience of the nominee are commensurate with the qualifications and experience specified for the nominated occupation in the ANZSCO Dictionary. The occupation of Developer Programmer has a skill level of a bachelor degree or higher qualification. At least five years of relevant experience and/or relevant vendor certification may substitute for the formal qualification. We understand that Anjani completed a Bachelor of Engineering at Thakral College of Technology, Bhopal. Under current immigration legislation, when a Subclass 457 visa holder is transferring their visa to a new sponsor (ie. lodgement of a new nomination application only), they should not be required to evidence their skills. In the unlikely event the immigration department does request evidence of Anjaniâs skills, we will advise further. The immigration department may request Anjani evidence his skills by way of employment references or qualifications. Evidence of Labour Market Testing To satisfy the Labour Market Testing criteria for this application. The business would need to provide evidence of advertising for the position that meets the following requirements: The evidence must consist of at least two advertisements placed on separate recruitment websites (such as Seek, Jora or Indeed) The advertisements must have run within four months leading to application lodgement; and Each advertisement must run for at least four weeks. The following details of the position must all be included in the advertisement: Â· the title or a description of the position; Â· the skills or experience required for the position; Â· Centelonâs business name or if you have engaged a recruitment agency for the purposes of the labour market testing, the name of the recruitment agency; Â· the salary for the position must be included in the body of advertisement, if the intended annual earnings for the nominated position are lower than $96,400.00 AUD. We would be pleased to review any advertisements once they have been posted. We note that the Department have recently announced an additional requirement for Labour Market Testing â a third advertisement posted on the Australian Governmentâs Job Active website. As a result of the amendment, businesses that are considering employing overseas skilled workers on TSS visas will now be required to advertise their vacancies on the Jobactive website for at least 4 weeks in addition to the two other advertisements that must be published in line with existing requirements. This applies to nominations lodged on or after 1 October 2020. Next Steps Please let us know if you would like us to reach out to Anjani to commence his TSS nomination transfer application. If you would like to proceed, please provide the following: Confirmation that the ANZSCO classification is appropriate or any queries you may have regarding the suggested occupation Evidence of Labour Market Testing (see above); Signed employment contract (this must be signed and dated after LMT has concluded); Evidence of Annual Market Salary Rate; If you already have an equivalent Australian working in the same position please provide: A copy of the individualâs signed employment contract; and Recent payslips or other evidence of current earnings (such as a salary review letter) If you do not have an equivalent Australia working in the position, you will be required to provide at least two sources of market salary evidence including: Job outlook website; Reputable industry wide remuneration surveys; Written advice form employer associations and/or trade unions; or Job advertisements form national recruitment or national print media in English and specifying salary. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you require anything further. \n",

We shall continue to follow the laid down rules and issue duly compliant GST invoices. Kindly consider this email as confirmation for your records.

Thus, in case status of your GSTIN is cancelled or inactive at the time of issuance of invoice and your GSTIN is rejected by IRP portal, we shall not be able to issue B2B invoice with IRN and QR Code. In such scenarios, B2C invoice would be raised by us basis which you would not be eligible to avail input tax credit. We request you to ensure 'Active' status of GSTIN status.

Try one or more of the following: Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link \"To send this message again, click here.\" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send. If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below. Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.1.10 This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following: The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages. Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory. Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature. Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit). Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly. For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.

The recipients weren't found at centelon.com. operations Office 365 Recipients Action Required Recipients Unknown To address Couldn't deliver to the following recipients: gokul.karuppuswamy@centelon.com, avinash.jadhav@centelon.com How to Fix It The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following: Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link \"To send this message again, click here.\" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send. Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct. The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly. Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send. If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below. Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.1.10 This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.

Try one or more of the following: Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link \"To send this message again, click here.\" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send. Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct. The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly. Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send. If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below. Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.1.10 This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.
